# ObsidianOS KDE
---
This is the main repo for ObsidianOS KDE flavor.

## What is ObsidianOS?
It is an Arch-based Linux distro with an A/B partition style, so if a package has a breaking change that causes some issues, you can just reboot into the other partition and restore the other one, while relying on the robustness of EXT4.
